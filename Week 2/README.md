Project Overview
This comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) project demonstrates a complete security assessment of a Metasploitable2 vulnerable environment. The project follows the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) methodology to identify, exploit, and document critical security vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment.

Key Objectives:

Conduct comprehensive network reconnaissance and service enumeration
Identify and exploit web application vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS)
Demonstrate service-level exploitation and privilege escalation
Document findings with evidence and provide actionable remediation
Follow industry-standard PTES methodology

Tools Used:

Nmap - Network reconnaissance and service enumeration

sqlmap - Automated SQL injection exploitation

Metasploit Framework - Service exploitation and post-exploitation

Nessus/OpenVAS - Vulnerability scanning

Burp Suite - Web application testing
