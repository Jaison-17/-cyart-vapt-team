Overview
This project demonstrates a full Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) cycle against a Metasploitable2 vulnerable environment, following PTES methodology to identify, exploit, and 
document security vulnerabilities.

Phase 1: Environment Setup
Step 1.1: Lab Configuration

 Kali Linux as attacking machine
 Metasploitable2 as target VM (192.168.29.108)
 VMware for virtualization
 Network: NAT

Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning
Step 2.1: Network Reconnaissance

 # Basic host discovery
 nmap -sn 192.168.29.0/24

# Comprehensive service scan
 nmap -sV -sC 192.168.29.108

Step 2.2: Vulnerability Assessment
 # Web application scanning
 nikto -h http://192.168.29.108

  Vulnerability Tracking:
  vulnerability tracking matrix identified 5 critical security flaws requiring immediate remediation, with SQL Injection posing the highest risk to data integrity

   Scan ID | Vulnerability       | CVSS Score | Priority | Host
--------|--------------------|------------|----------|---------------
   001     | SQL Injection      | 9.1        | Critical | 192.168.29.108

Phase 3: Exploitation

"Successful exploitation demonstrated complete system compromise"
"The vulnerability was weaponized to achieve unauthorized access"
"Proof-of-concept exploitation validated the security weakness"

 Results: Complete database compromise with all user credentials extracted and cracked.

Phase 4: Post-Exploitation

 Step 4.1: Privilege Escalation
 Achieved root access through multiple vectors
 System enumeration and information gathering
 Network configuration analysis

Phase 5: Documentation & Reporting

 Step 5.1: Activity Logging

  Timestamp            | Target IP      | Vulnerability | PTES Phase
--------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------
2025-11-04 12:00:05 | 192.168.29.108 | SQL Injection | Exploitation

Key Tools & Technologies :
 Nmap: Network discovery and service enumerationsqlmap: Automated SQL injection tool
 Nessus: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
 
 sqlmap: Automated SQL injection tool
 Metasploit: Exploitation framework
 Burp Suite: Web application testing

This capstone project successfully demonstrated a complete VAPT lifecycle from initial reconnaissance through final reporting. The assessment revealed critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to
complete system compromise in a real-world scenario. The project highlights the importance of regular security assessments, patch management, and defense-in-depth strategies
