Lab Environment Setup:

Prerequisites:

VirtualBox/VMware
Kali Linux VM
Metasploitable2 VM
DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
VulnHub VMs (Kioptrix series recommended)

5. Capstone Project: Full VAPT Cycle
Activities:
Tools: Kali Linux, Metasploit, OpenVAS/Nessus, Google Docs.
Tasks: Simulate a full pentest, exploit, report.
Brief:
Simulation: Exploit a VulnHub VM (e.g., Kioptrix) with Metasploit (e.g., use exploit/linux/http/drupal_drupageddon). Follow TryHackMe guides.
Detection: Log OpenVAS findings:
Timestamp            | Target IP      | Vulnerability | PTES Phase
--------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------
2025-08-25 13:00:00 | 192.168.1.150  | Drupal RCE    | Exploitation
Remediation: Suggest patches, rescan to verify.
Reporting: Write a 200-word PTES report in Google Docs:
Executive Summary
Findings
Recommendations
Briefing: Draft a 100-word non-technical summary.
